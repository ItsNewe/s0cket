## Privacy

[The official s0cket instance](https://s0cket.fangsystems.tech) does not, and never will, log any data other than the basic IP information needed to establish a connection to the webserver, in addition to the basic routing information needed to connect peers.
File exchanges being of peer-to-peer nature, s0cket does not have knowledge of the nature of the files that are exchanged.
s0cket uses file hashes in order to verify that packets haven't been manipulated during transfer.
